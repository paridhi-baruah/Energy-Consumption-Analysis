This project addresses the challenge of optimizing energy consumption for a company that provides water, electricity, and gas across various locations. I utilized Power BI to develop an interactive dashboard, empowering informed decision-making and promoting sustainable energy practices.

# Key Challenges:
* Effectively monitor and control energy usage across different building types and locations.
* Detect trends, anomalies, and areas for improvement in energy consumption.
* Optimise operations and ensure cost-effectiveness for energy resources.

# My Solution:
I developed an in-depth Power BI dashboard with dedicated sections for water, electricity, and gas. Each section includes:
* Consumption Patterns: Analyzed usage trends across various buildings and time periods to identify anomalies and seasonal changes, such as increased water use during summer, which may require further investigation into irrigation practices or leak detection.
* Cost Analysis: Monitored annual costs and identified potential savings opportunities. Broke down costs by energy type and building to highlight areas with significant expenditures, revealing opportunities for energy-efficient upgrades or better supplier negotiations.
* Interactive Features: Utilized slicers and filters to enable user-driven exploration. Allowed users to compare consumption patterns across different building types, locations, and time periods, facilitating targeted analysis and identifying buildings with persistently high consumption rates.

 # Technical Skills:
* Power Query: Utilized Power Query to effectively cleanse and transform raw data from multiple tables into a unified format, ensuring data accuracy and consistency for reliable analysis.
* Data Modeling: Developed a structured data model by linking relevant columns across tables, enhancing data exploration efficiency and reducing errors in calculations and visualizations.
* DAX Measures: Designed custom DAX measures to compute key performance indicators (KPIs) essential for energy analysis, such as total cost, unit consumption by energy type, percentage breakdowns, and efficiency ratios like cost per unit consumed. These tailored DAX formulas provided valuable insights specific to the project's needs.
* Data Visualization: Created interactive charts and graphs with Power BIâ€™s visualization tools to present complex energy consumption data clearly. Utilized conditional formatting to highlight anomalies and key areas, directing attention to critical insights.

# Actionable Results:
* Water as the Dominant Resource: Identified water as the primary resource, representing 88.49% of total energy consumption. Despite fluctuations in water usage over the years, the overall cost remained stable, indicating opportunities for conservation without significant budget impact.
* Decreasing Gas Consumption and Costs:  Observed a decreasing trend in gas consumption and costs from 2016 to 2019, warranting further investigation. Potential factors include:
* Policy Changes: Reviewed company-wide initiatives or policy changes aimed at improving energy efficiency, such as the adoption of LED lighting or appliance upgrades.
* Infrastructure Upgrades: Assessed any building renovations or infrastructure upgrades that may have enhanced energy efficiency, including better insulation or upgraded heating systems.
* Alternative Energy Sources:  Investigated whether the company shifted to alternative energy sources for gas-related activities, such as solar or other renewable energy options.
* Need for Additional Data Points: TThe analysis highlighted the need for more data points, such as building types and locations, to gain a comprehensive understanding. By incorporating these details, I can:
* Benchmarking: Compare energy consumption patterns across similar building types (e.g., offices vs. residential) to identify improvement areas within each category.
* Location Analysis: Examine energy consumption by geographic location to identify correlations with weather patterns or regional infrastructure differences, aiding in the development of targeted conservation strategies for specific areas.

# Impact:
This project enables the company to make informed decisions that enhance sustainable energy practices, optimize resource allocation, and achieve cost savings. Utilizing Power BI and my data analysis expertise, I aim to drive progress toward a more sustainable future.
